This is a very small package made to try and assist the DE team with Book Scanning Projects.

There are two functions, ImageReorder and HEIC_to_JPG.

HEIC_to_JPG converts all .HEIC files in a provided directory to .jpg, so they can be uploaded to the DE app as book pages.

ImageReorder is intended to reorder the files in the event that one page set (left pages vs. right pages) is scanned at a time for the sake of scanning speed.
